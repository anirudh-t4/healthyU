### Overview

_Joyce Meyer said, “I believe that the greatest gift you can give to your family and the world is a healthy you”_.

_If a person stays healthy physically, he will stay healthy mentally too. Physical and mental health is linked fundamentally. If we are able to keep our body fit and healthy by taking the right food and doing physical activates regularly, our body will definitely help us to deal with daily stress._ 

_Keeping in mind above points we have decided to make Healthyu .HealthyU is focused to cover almost all aspects related to Healthcare in a single app.HealthyU has 10_ _categories which relate to covid detection through lung x-ray, Yoga posture correction, Doctor Patient interaction, BMI calculation, Donate, Symptoms Detector , Medicine_ _Reminder , Covid resources , 14-day self tracker and BP measuring using camera and flash.

### _Challenges we ran into_
